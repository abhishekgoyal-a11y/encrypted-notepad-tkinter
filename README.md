# encrypted-notepad-tkinter
This is encrypted notepad ,means the text is saved in encrypted format with extension ".txt" , whenever someone open this file from normal notepad it will not show the original 
text , but when we open the file from this encrypted notepad it will show the orignal text
I have used python language for making this gui ,library used here is tkinter and os.
