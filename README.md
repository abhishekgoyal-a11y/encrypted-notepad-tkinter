# encrypted-notepad-tkinter
This is encrypted notepad , whenever we write text in encrypted notepad the text is saved in encrypted format with extensions ".txt" , when we open the same file with normal notepad it will not show the original text, but when we open the same file from this encrypted notepad it will show the orignal text.
Here i have used python language for making this gui ,library used here is tkinter and os.
